# Hi, I'm Arup, welcome to my Digital Domain!

Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Illinois Tech, I'm passionate about software engineering, open-source contributions, and making databases optimized.


When I'm not coding, I'm diving into sneaker culture or whipping up culinary masterpieces while I play great music. My passion for tech is only rivaled by my love for great food and stylish footwear.
